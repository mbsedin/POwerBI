## WHAT US DAX
DAX   == Data Analysis Expressions.
It's the formula language that drives Power BI.

## WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH DAX?
-  Add calculated columns
-  Add measures to your model

## CALCULATED COLUMNS:
Calculated columns allow you to add new, formula-based columns to tables.

  ### NOTES:
  -  No "A-style" references; calculated columns refer to entire tables or columns
  -  Calculated columns generate values for each row, which are visible with tables in the Data view
  -  Calculated columns understand "row context"; they are great for defining properties based on information in each row,
     but generally useless for aggregation (SUM, COUNT, etc)

      #### NB: 
      Calculated columns are typically used for "FILTERING DATA", rather than "creating/defining new numerical values"
              -  As a rule of thumb, use calculated columns when you wnat to "stamp" static , fixed values to each row
                 in a table (or use the query editor!)

              -  DO NOT use calculated columns for aggregation formulas, or to calculated fields for the "values" area
                 of a visualization (use measures instead)

## MEASURES
Measures are DAX formulas used to generate new calculated values.
-  Like calculated columns, measures reference "entire tables" or "columns" (no A1-style or "grid" reference)
-  Unlike calculated columns, "measures" values aren't visible within tables;
   They can only be "seen" within a visualization like a chart or matrix (similar to a calculated field in an excel pivot)
-  Measures are evaluated based on "filter context", which means they recalculate when the fields or filters around them change (like when new
    row or column labels are pulled into a matrix or when filters are applied to a report)

## NB:
 A a rule of thumb: 
use measures (vs. calculated columns) when a single row can't give you the answer  (in other worrds, when you need to aggragte)
use measures to create numerical , calculated values that can be analysed in the "values" field of a report visual
