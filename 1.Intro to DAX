## WHAT US DAX
DAX   == Data Analysis Expressions.
It's the formula language that drives Power BI.

## WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH DAX?
-  Add calculated columns
-  Add measures to your model

## CALCULATED COLUMNS:
Calculated columns allow you to add new, formula-based columns to tables.

  ### NOTES:
  -  No "A-style" references; calculated columns refer to entire tables or columns
  -  Calculated columns generate values for each row, which are visible with tables in the Data view
  -  Calculated columns understand "row context"; they are great for defining properties based on information in each row,
     but generally useless for aggregation (SUM, COUNT, etc)

      #### NB: 
      Calculated columns are typically used for "FILTERING DATA", rather than "creating/defining new numerical values"
              -  As a rule of thumb, use calculated columns when you wnat to "stamp" static , fixed values to each row
                 in a table (or use the query editor!)

              -  DO NOT use calculated columns for aggregation formulas, or to calculated fields for the "values" area
                 of a visualization (use measures instead)
