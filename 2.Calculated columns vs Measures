## CALCULATED COLUMNS
1.  Values are calculated on information from each row of a table(has "row context")
2.  Appends static values to each row in a table and stores them in the model (which increases file size)
3.  Recalculate on data source refresh or when changes are made to component columns.
4.  Primarily  used as rows, columns, slicers or filters

## MEASURES
1.  Values are calculated  based on information from any filters in the report (has filter context)
2.  Does not create new data in the tables themselves (doesn't increase file size)
3.  Recalculate in reponse to any change to filters within the report
4.  Almost always used within the values field of a visual

## ADDING COLUMNS & MEASURES
### OPTION 1: Select "New Measure" or "New Column" from the modeling tab (****NOT RECOMMENDED****)
### OPTION 2: Right-click within the table (in the Data view) or the Field List( in either the Data or report View)
