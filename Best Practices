## Before Loading the data into Power BI
1.  Define clear and intuitive table names (no spaces!) from the start; updating them later can be a headache,
specially of you've referenced  them in multiple places.
2.  Esatblsh a file/folder structure that makes sense from the start, 
to avoid having top modify data source settings if file names or locations change.

## Disabling report refresh for any static sources
1.  There's no need to constantly refresh sources that don't update frequently (or not all),
like lookups or static data tables; only enable refresh for tables thay will be changing.

## When working with large tables, only load the data you need
Don't include hourly data when you only need daily
