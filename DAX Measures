Measures are DAX formulas used to generate new calculated values.

-  Like calculated columns, measures reference "entire tables" or "columns" (no A1-style or "grid" reference)
-  Unlike calculated columns, "measures" values aren't visible within tables;
   They can only be "seen" within a visualization like a chart or matrix (similar to a calculated field in an excel pivot)
-  Measures are evaluated based on "filter context", which means they recalculate when the fields or filters around them change (like when new
    row or column labels are pulled into a matrix or when filters are applied to a report)

## NB:
 A a rule of thumb: 
use measures (vs. calculated columns) when a single row can't give you the answer  (in other worrds, when you need to aggragte
use measures to create numerical , calculated values that can be analysed in the "values" field of a report visual
