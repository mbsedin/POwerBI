## IMPLICIT MEASURES:
Implicit measures are created  when you drag raw numerical fields (like "OrderQuantity") into the values pane of a visual 
and manually select the aggregation mode (sum, Average, Min/Max, etc)

## EXPLICIT MEASURES:
Explicit measures are calculated by actually entering DAX functions (or adding "quick measures") to define calculated columns or measures.

## NOTE !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Implicit measures are only accessible within the specific visualization in which it was created, and cannot be referenced  elsewhere.
Explicit measures can be used anywhere in the report, and referenced within other DAX calculations to create "measure trees"

#### NB: It's ok to use spaces in measures.They will be surrounded in brackets.
