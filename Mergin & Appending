## Merging

Merging queries allows you to "join tables" based on a common column (Like VLOOKUP)

Note: Mergin adds columns to an existing table.
Just because you can merge tables, doesn't mean you should.
In general, it's better to keep tables separate  and define relationships between them.

## Appending

Appending queries allows you to conbine (or stack) tables that share the exact "same column structure and data  types."
Note 1: Appding adds rows to an existing table.

Folder Option: (Get data >more> Folder) to append all files within a folder ( assuming they share the same structure); 
as you add new files,simply refresh the query and they automatically  append
